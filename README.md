## Notes

Requesting the route may take a minute if the heroku instance is cold, I did not add a loading state.

I built this application using `create-react-app`.  I did my best to mimic what I would do in a production environment. 

I added ES-lint for code and style enforcement. I used the AirBNB standard since it's what I'm used to and I like how it handles accessibility standards (though buttons can be a pain).

Material-UI is a nice component library I don't often get a chance to use but it comes with the additional benefit of having a scoped-styling solution in the form of JSS.

Due to time constraints I didn't add all of the error handling I would have liked.

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
